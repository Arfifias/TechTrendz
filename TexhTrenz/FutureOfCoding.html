    <h1 class="Coding"><u>The code</u></h1>
    <p class="TheCode">The first programming language was created by Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, in the
        mid-1800s. She is considered the world's first programmer.

        The term "bug" to refer to a software error originated from the early days of computing when a moth got trapped
        in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, is credited with coining
        the term "debugging" when she removed the moth from the computer.

        The most widely used programming language in the world is JavaScript. It is a versatile language that can be
        used for web development, server-side scripting, game development, and more.

        The first high-level programming language was Fortran (Formula Translation), developed in the 1950s. It was
        designed for scientific and engineering calculations.

        Python, a popular and versatile programming language, is named after the British comedy show "Monty Python's
        Flying Circus" and not the snake.

        The "Hello, World!" program is often the first program a beginner writes when learning a new programming
        language. It simply prints "Hello, World!" on the screen and serves as a basic introduction to coding syntax.

        The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) was first developed in the 1960s but became widely popular with
        the release of the programming language Smalltalk in the 1970s.

        The first computer programmer to use punched cards to program a computer was Herman Hollerith. He used this
        method for data processing in the late 1800s and later founded the company that became IBM.

        The World Wide Web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN (European Organization for
        Nuclear Research).

        The longest officially recognized English word that can be written with just the top row of a QWERTY keyboard is
        "typewriter."

        The famous "Ctrl+Alt+Delete" key combination was designed by David Bradley, an IBM engineer. It was intended to
        be used by programmers but later became widely known for rebooting computers.

        The term "debugging" has a literal origin. In the early days of computing, engineers had to physically remove
        insects or "bugs" from machines that caused malfunctions.

        The original iPhone released by Apple in 2007 ran on a mobile version of Mac OS X. Later, it was rebranded as
        iOS.

        The first computer programmer to win a Nobel Prize was John Bardeen, who won it twice for his contributions to
        the invention of the transistor and the development of the theory of superconductivity.

        The popular version control system "Git" was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created the Linux
        operating system.

        These facts highlight the fascinating history and fun facts about coding and the world of computer science.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="Developers"><u>Legendary Developers</u></h2>

    <p class="TheCode2">Linus Torvalds: Creator of the Linux kernel, which is the foundation of the open-source Linux
        operating system.

        Tim Berners-Lee: Inventor of the World Wide Web and the HTTP protocol.

        Grace Hopper: A pioneering computer scientist who played a key role in the development of early programming
        languages and COBOL.

        Ada Lovelace: Often considered the world's first programmer, she wrote the first algorithm for Charles Babbage's
        Analytical Engine.

        Dennis Ritchie: Co-creator of the C programming language and one of the key developers of the Unix operating
        system.

        Bjarne Stroustrup: Creator of the C++ programming language, which builds upon the C language with
        object-oriented features.

        Margaret Hamilton: A computer scientist who led the development of onboard flight software for NASA's Apollo
        missions.

        James Gosling: Known as the "Father of Java," he designed the Java programming language.

        Guido van Rossum: Creator of the Python programming language, known for its simplicity and readability.

        John Carmack: A game programmer and co-founder of id Software, known for his work on pioneering video games like
        Doom and Quake.

        These developers have made significant contributions to the world of computing, and their work has shaped the
        technology landscape as we know it today. There are, of course, many other notable developers who have also made
        important contributions to the field.</p><br>

    <h2 class="text"><u>Text Editors</u></h2>

    <p class="textEditors">Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Developed by Microsoft, VS Code is a highly popular, free, and
        open-source code editor with a wide range of extensions and excellent support for various programming languages.

        Sublime Text: Known for its speed and simplicity, Sublime Text is a lightweight text editor with a powerful
        feature set and a vast community creating various plugins.

        Atom: An open-source text editor developed by GitHub, Atom is customizable and hackable, offering a rich
        ecosystem of packages and themes.

        Vim: A highly configurable and powerful text editor that runs in the terminal, Vim is favored by many
        experienced developers for its efficiency and keyboard-driven interface.

        Emacs: Similar to Vim, Emacs is a highly customizable and extensible text editor, with a rich set of features
        and a dedicated user base.

        JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm): These are not text editors per se, but integrated
        development environments (IDEs) with advanced features for specific programming languages like Java, Python, and
        JavaScript.

        Notepad++: A free and lightweight text editor for Windows, Notepad++ is popular for its simplicity and extensive
        plugin support.

        Visual Studio: A powerful IDE from Microsoft, Visual Studio, offers robust features for software development in
        various languages, especially for Windows applications.

        developing bundles for various languages and tools.

        Keep in mind that the coding text editor you choose depends on your workflow, programming language preferences,
        and specific features you require. Many developers also prefer using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
        that provide more advanced features like debugging, code analysis, and integrated tools specific to a particular
        language or framework. It's a good idea to try out a few editors or IDEs to find the one that best suits your
        needs and enhances your productivity.</p>
