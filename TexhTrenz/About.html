        Worth mentioning that this blog was made by one single developer.Bare in mind sometimes coding can be
        frustrating with due to errors.
        Error handling can be an excrusiating pain sometimes due to the fact that the developer must spend hours trying
        to solve problems but in our case this blog was written in HTML and CSS and an error handling process was not
        needed.
